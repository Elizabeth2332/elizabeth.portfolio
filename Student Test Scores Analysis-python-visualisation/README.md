## 📈 What This Notebook Does

The notebook:
- Imports a list of student test scores
- Calculates key statistics:
  - **Mean** – Average score
  - **Median** – Middle value
  - **Mode** – Most frequent score(s)
  - **Standard Deviation** – How spread out the scores are
- Visualizes the data with a **histogram** using `matplotlib`, with:
  - A red line for **mean**
  - A green dashed line for **median**
  - Purple dashed lines for **mode**
  - A blue dashed line for **standard deviation**
