# 🧠 Quiz Game & 🧮 BMI Calculator – Python Mini Project

Welcome to my Python mini-project portfolio! This project includes two beginner-friendly Python programs combined into one interactive console app:

1. **Quiz Game** – A fun general knowledge quiz with multiple-choice questions.
2. **BMI Calculator** – A tool that calculates your Body Mass Index (BMI) using either Metric or Imperial units.

## 🚀 Features

- 🔹 **User-Friendly Menu**: Choose between the Quiz Game or the BMI Calculator.
- 🔹 **Personalized Experience**: The user is greeted by name, which is used throughout the app.
- 🔹 **Quiz Game**:
  - Multiple-choice questions with four options.
  - Randomized question and answer order.
  - Feedback on correct/incorrect answers.
  - Final score display.
- 🔹 **BMI Calculator**:
  - Choose between Metric (kg, meters) or Imperial (lbs, inches) units.
  - Input validation for height and weight.
  - BMI calculation with classification:
    - Underweight
    - Normal
    - Overweight
    - Obese
  - Rounded BMI display with category result.
- 🔁 **Menu Loop**: After completing one task, the user can choose to run another or exit the program.
